# CV


### Characterize the final user:

#### **Who will be the final user?**

Recruiters, not necessarily programmers, but people that had experienced  similar webs form the other candidates. The information have to be well divided and easy to find, it doesn't have to be crowded if you don’t want the recruiter to not find the useful information and leave the page early.

#### **What is he/she expected to find in your project?**

You will give him the link to the page in the resume, it would be highly unlikable that they found the page on internet and wanted to offer you a job due the uncertainty of not knowing if you are looking for a job in that moment, or know if you live in a relatively short distance to commute on a daily basis. 
For this reason you could always have to keep in mind the type of companies who you send the link, because they expect to find relevant information  regarding its field.

Information architecture: in this project, which is assumed to be a single- page project, this analysis isn’t very relevant

The categorization of content to be easily found was the core of the web design, for this reason the first look on the page you see the name, a brief description and a menu. When hover over the menu, the changing of the text usually indicates that can be pressed. When done, the web will scroll to the desired category, showing to the user that the web can be scrolled even if the outline of the start page where emphasized. 


### Visual design: 

#### **Which color palette will you use? Which typography?**

 I tried to keep the page bicolor so the only colors I chose were:
![Pallete](ColorPalete.jpg?raw=true "Pallete")


To make sure everybody that enters the web have the same appearance I didn’t use a font that has been already installed in the computer, because this means that someone that doesn't have it installed will see the page different, for that reason I imported the font from google fonts each time that you load the page you will have the same font. The fonts name is Raleway. 
![Font Used](fontUsed.jpg?raw=true "Font")

#### **Which page layout? **

I use the web figma to make a mock up of the project, but in the end some changes where included for convenience and for aesthetics purposes.

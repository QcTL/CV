### Characterize the final user:

#### **Who will be the final user?**

The final user of the page will be primarily recruiters of the companies I presented my resume. They may not have a technical view of programming. The page will be compared to the other candidates that also presented for the job, so the information has to be well-divided, concise, and easy to find. You wouldn't want a recruiter to leave the page early because they have to read too much information to know more about you.

#### **What is he/she expected to find in your project?**

You will give him the link to the page in the resume, it would be highly unlikeable that they found the page on the internet and wanted to offer you a job due to the uncertainty of not knowing if you are looking for a job at that moment, or know if you live in a relatively short distance to commute on a daily basis. 
For this reason, you could always have to keep in mind the type of companies who you send the link because they expect to find relevant information regarding its field.

In the project, the recruiter has to find out what programming languages I develop the most, and some projects to show at which level I can use the language. They can also have to find my past work experience and my level of education. If they deemed me to have a sufficient level for the job, the page has to also contain the necessary information about where to find me.

#### **Information architecture**:

The categorization of content to be easily found was the core of the web design. On the first look at the page, you only see the name, a brief description, and a menu. At first glance, you only see the most basic information, but with the help of the menu, you can see the specific information and where to find it. 
When hovering over the menu, the changing size of the text indicates that they can be pressed. When done, the web will scroll to the desired category, only showing the desired information at that moment without overcrowing the page.


### Visual design: 

#### **Which color palette will you use? Which typography?**

To help the page look even less overcrowded and minimalist, and taking notes from the works of Keita Yamada, I selected only two colors with very high contrast.
These colors are:

To make sure everybody that enters the web has the same appearance, I didnâ€™t use a font that has to be already installed on the computer. Because if not installed, they will see the page differently. For that reason, I imported the font from google fonts, so each time you load the page you will have the same font no matter the computer you are using. 
The font name is Raleway.

#### **Which page layout?**

I used Figma to make a mock-up of the project, but in the end, some changes were included for convenience and aesthetic purposes.

As said before, the page is divided into different categories, each one with a different technical description of me. The first one is about what I know and how I use it. The second is about what I have done in the past, academically and work-wise. And the last one is where to find me.
